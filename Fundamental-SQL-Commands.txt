Fundamental SQL Commands

1.	List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.
      •	Command to add data:
          •	INSERT
      •	Command to update data:
          •	UPDATE
      •	Command to delete data:
          •	DELETE

2.	Explain the structure for each type of command.
      •	INSERT INTO:
          •	We can insert date into the table: INSERT INTO <table name>
          •	 We can choose a specific row : INSERT INTO <row name> VALUE <what you want added to the row>
          •	We can choose a specific Column: INSERT INTO < column name> VALUE<what you want added to the column>
      •	UPDATE:
          •	UPDATE <table you want updated> SET <value to add> WHERE <where you want it updated>
      •	DELETE FROM:
          •	DELETE FROM <name of table> WHERE <to specify what value you want deleted>

3.	What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.
      •	Money: “$15.00”
      •	Text: “Lindsay k”
      •	Time: “12:00”

4.	Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).
      •	Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
      •	First and last name: Text
      •	Whether they sent in their RSVP: Boolean
      •	Number of guests: Integer
      •	Number of meals: decimal
      •	Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

      CREATE TABLE wedding dinner (
        Name text,
        Guests integer
        Meals decimal
      );

      •	Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
          Answer: ALTER TABLE wedding dinner ADD COLUMN thank you card boolean;

      •	You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
      	  Answer: ALTER TABLE wedding dinner DROP COLUMN meals;

      •	The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
          Answer: ALTER TABLE wedding dinner ADD COLUMN table number integer;

      •	The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
          Answer: ALTER TABLE wedding dinner DROP COLUMN table number;

5.	Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

        CREATE TABLE library(
          ISBN integer,
          Title text,
          Author text,
          Genre text,
          Publishing date date,
          Number of copies integer,
          Available copies integer
        );

        •	Find three books and add their information to the table.
            Answer:

            INSERT INTO library (ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, available copies)
              VALUES
                (9780385738781, ‘The Death Cure’, ‘James Dashner’, ‘science fiction’, ‘October 11, 2011’, 15, 13),
                (9781847242532, ‘The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Steg Larson’, ‘crime, mystery, thriller’, August 2005, 10, 9),
                (0312010737, ‘Not Without My Daughter’, ‘Betty Mahmoody, William Hoffer’, ‘Biogrpahy, 1987, 3, 3);

        •	Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
            Answer: UPDATE library SET ‘available copies=2 WHERE title= ‘Not Without My Daughter’;

        •	Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
            Answer:	DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN=9781847242532;

6.	Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:

      CREATE TABLE spacecrafts(
	       id integer,
	       name text,
	       year launched integer,
         country of origin text,
         description of mission text,
         orbiting body text,
         currently operating Boolean,
         approximate miles from earth integer
	    );

	  Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
      Answer:

	     INSERT INTO spacecrafts(id, name, year launched, country of origin, description of mission, orbiting body, currently operating, approximate miles from earth)
	      VALUES
          (1, ‘2001 Mars Odyssey’, 2001, ‘United States’, ‘Its mission is to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment’,’Mars’, y, 2,883,050),
          (2, ‘Mars Express’, 2003, ‘Khazakstan’, ‘To study of the interior, subsurface, surface and atmosphere, and environment of the planet Mars’, ‘Mars’, y, 2854840),
          (3, ‘Mars Orbiter Mission’, 2013, ‘India’, ‘The mission is a "technology demonstrator" project to develop the technologies for designing, planning, management, and operations of an interplanetary mission.’, ‘Mars’, ‘y’, 2,780,000)

    •	Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
      Answer: DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=1;

    •	Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
      Answer: UPDATE spacecrafts SET currently operating=’n’ WHERE id=2;

7.	Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:
        CREATE TABLE inbox(
          id integer,
          subject line text
          sender text
          additional recipients text
          email body text
          timestamp time
          read or unread Boolean
          id of email chain its in integer
        );

        •	Add three new emails to the inbox.
	       Answer:
          INSERT INTO inbox(id, subject line, sender, additional recipients, email body, timestamp, read or unread, id of email chain)
            VALUES
              (111, ‘Good Morning’, ‘Lindsay K’, ‘none’, ‘Hello, Write me back some time’, time, ‘y’, 12222),
              (112, ‘Good Afternoon’, ‘Luna K’, ‘none’, ‘Hope your day is going well, let me know about this weekend.’, ‘time’, ‘y’, 12223),
      	      (113, ‘Good Evening’, ‘Elise’, ‘Luna’ , ‘Hey, Are we still on for Wednesday’, time, ‘y’, 12224);

        •	You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
            Answer: DELETE FROM inbox WHERE id=111;
        •	You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.
            Answer: UPDATE inbox SET read or unread=’n’ WHERE id=113;
